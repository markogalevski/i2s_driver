# i2s_driver_stm32f4xx - a generalised driver for a very specific use

This is a driver I'm writing for my project, the Sitcom Machine, for which I will start a repository and Github Pages page once there is anything worth showing.

A fledgling driver for the transmission of audio via i2s. Although initially designed simply for the i2s/spi peripheral on the stm32f4xx series of MCUs, I am moving towards the development of a common interface for all implementations to come.
